# Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM)

Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM) is a framework for understanding how meaning systems shape human experience.

It approaches mythological, mystical, and metaphysical traditions not as truth claims or paths to follow, but as **human meaning interfaces** — symbolic systems that orient perception, identity, and agency in different ways.

MMM is designed to **demystify**, not to initiate.

MMM describes patterns of engagement, not individual psychology.

## Core Idea

Most mythological, mystical, and metaphysical systems can be understood along a single underlying axis:

**Differentiation ↔ Dissolution**

- **Differentiation** emphasises boundaries, distinction, responsibility, and enacted meaning.
- **Dissolution** emphasises unity, boundary-softening, identity loosening, and meaning as inherent.

Neither pole is “higher” or more true.

Health lies in **sequencing and oscillation**, not permanent residence at either extreme.

## What This Project Is

MMM is:

- **Descriptive**, not prescriptive  
- **Analytical**, not devotional  
- **Protective**, not expansive  
- **Concerned with agency**, not belief  

It explains how meaning systems *work* on the human mind, how they feel compelling, and where they can destabilise cognition if mis-sequenced or absolutised.

---

## What This Project Is Not

MMM is not:

- a spiritual teaching  
- a metaphysical worldview  
- a path, practice, or initiation  
- a claim about ultimate reality  

It does not ask the reader to adopt beliefs, identities, or experiences.

---

## Safety and Sequencing

Meaning systems that emphasise dissolution can be powerful and relieving, but also risky if engaged without sufficient stability.

This project prioritises:
- clarity over depth  
- grounding over transcendence  
- agency over absorption  

Readers are encouraged to treat this material as **orientation**, not exploration.

## Relation to the Dynamic Field Model (DFM)

MMM is independent from, but lightly contextualised by, practical navigational frameworks such as the **Dynamic Field Model (DFM)**.

- DFM focuses on coherence, regulation, and differentiation.
- MMM focuses on interpretation safety and meaning literacy.

DFM is not required to read MMM, but may be helpful for readers interested in grounding and integration.

## How to Read This Repository

This repository is intentionally small and bounded.

Suggested order:
1. Orientation and boundaries  
2. The core Differentiation ↔ Dissolution axis  
3. Failure modes and misapplications  
4. A small number of illustrative case studies  

There is no expectation to read everything, and no pressure to go deeper.

---

## Status

MMM is intentionally minimal.

Its purpose is not to grow indefinitely, but to make itself **less necessary over time** by clarifying a domain that often generates confusion.

If this framework helps you think more clearly and safely about meaning systems, it has done its job.
