# Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM)

Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM) is a framework for understanding how meaning systems shape human experience.

It approaches mythological, mystical, and metaphysical traditions not as truth claims or paths to follow, but as **human meaning interfaces** — symbolic systems that orient perception, identity, and agency in different ways.

MMM is designed to **demystify**, not to initiate.

MMM describes patterns of engagement, not individual psychology.

## Intent and Use

Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM) is intended as an interpretive framework for understanding how meaning systems affect human cognition, identity, and agency. It exists to clarify, contextualise, and demystify mythological, mystical, and metaphysical material — not to promote belief, practice, or experiential engagement.

MMM may be used for educational, analytical, or reflective purposes, provided it is not used to assert metaphysical authority, encourage identity dissolution, or position interpretation as superior to lived responsibility. The framework is explicitly designed to preserve agency, encourage restraint, and support disengagement rather than dependence. Uses that invite immersion, initiation, or identity capture are inconsistent with its intent.

## Core Idea

Most mythological, mystical, and metaphysical systems can be understood along a single underlying axis:

**Differentiation ↔ Dissolution**

- **Differentiation** emphasises boundaries, distinction, responsibility, and enacted meaning.
- **Dissolution** emphasises unity, boundary-softening, identity loosening, and meaning as inherent.

Neither pole is “higher” or more true.

Health lies in **sequencing and oscillation**, not permanent residence at either extreme.

## What This Project Is

MMM is:

- **Descriptive**, not prescriptive  
- **Analytical**, not devotional  
- **Protective**, not expansive  
- **Concerned with agency**, not belief  

It explains how meaning systems *work* on the human mind, how they feel compelling, and where they can destabilise cognition if mis-sequenced or absolutised.

---

## What This Project Is Not

MMM is not:

- a spiritual teaching  
- a metaphysical worldview  
- a path, practice, or initiation  
- a claim about ultimate reality  

It does not ask the reader to adopt beliefs, identities, or experiences.

---

## Safety and Sequencing

Meaning systems that emphasise dissolution can be powerful and relieving, but also risky if engaged without sufficient stability.

This project prioritises:
- clarity over depth  
- grounding over transcendence  
- agency over absorption  

Readers are encouraged to treat this material as **orientation**, not exploration.

## Relation to the Dynamic Field Model (DFM)

MMM is independent from, but lightly contextualised by, practical navigational frameworks such as the **Dynamic Field Model (DFM)**.

- DFM focuses on coherence, regulation, and differentiation.
- MMM focuses on interpretation safety and meaning literacy.

DFM is not required to read MMM, but may be helpful for readers interested in grounding and integration.

## How to Read This Repository

This repository is intentionally small and bounded.

Suggested order:
1. Orientation and boundaries  
2. The core Differentiation ↔ Dissolution axis  
3. Failure modes and misapplications  
4. A small number of illustrative case studies  

There is no expectation to read everything, and no pressure to go deeper.

---

## Status

MMM is intentionally minimal.

Its purpose is not to grow indefinitely, but to make itself **less necessary over time** by clarifying a domain that often generates confusion.

If this framework helps you think more clearly and safely about meaning systems, it has done its job.
