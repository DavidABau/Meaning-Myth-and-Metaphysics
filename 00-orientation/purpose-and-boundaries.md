# Purpose and Boundaries

## Purpose

The purpose of Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics (MMM) is to **clarify how meaning systems operate**, not to promote or replace them.

Mythological, mystical, and metaphysical frameworks have historically served as:
- symbolic compression systems,
- identity-orienting narratives,
- and experiential meaning interfaces.

MMM examines these systems structurally — how they affect perception, identity, agency, and behaviour — without requiring belief, participation, or experiential engagement.

The goal is **understanding without immersion**.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Domains involving myth, mysticism, and metaphysics often generate:
- confusion between symbolism and reality,
- authority inflation,
- premature dissolution of identity or responsibility,
- and difficulty distinguishing insight from destabilisation.

MMM exists to:
- demystify these domains,
- reduce unnecessary risk,
- and preserve human agency and discernment.

It is a protective framework, not an invitation.

---

## Core Boundary

MMM does not answer metaphysical questions.

It does not attempt to determine:
- what is ultimately real,
- what consciousness is,
- or what the universe means.

Instead, it asks a different question:

> **What do meaning systems do to the human mind when engaged?**

This shift keeps the project grounded and non-speculative.

---

## Descriptive, Not Prescriptive

MMM is strictly descriptive.

It:
- explains mechanisms,
- names patterns,
- and identifies failure modes.

It does **not**:
- recommend practices,
- offer spiritual guidance,
- or encourage identity shifts.

Readers remain responsible for how they engage with meaning systems outside this repository.

## Containment Over Expansion

This project intentionally resists growth for its own sake.

Depth is not treated as a virtue.
Complexity is not treated as insight.
Opacity is not treated as wisdom.

If a concept cannot be explained simply and safely,
it does not belong here.

---

## Who This Is For

MMM may be useful for:
- people encountering mystical or metaphysical ideas and wanting clarity,
- practitioners seeking to understand risks and failure modes,
- designers, educators, or researchers working with meaning-rich systems,
- readers who value grounding and agency over transcendence.

MMM is **not** intended for readers seeking spiritual experience or revelation.

---

## Who This Is Not For

MMM may not be appropriate for:
- individuals currently experiencing identity instability,
- readers seeking metaphysical certainty,
- those looking for spiritual authority or guidance,
- or anyone wanting meaning systems to provide answers rather than context.

Choosing not to engage is a valid outcome.

---

## Relation to Other Frameworks

MMM is independent and self-contained.

It may reference other frameworks (such as the Dynamic Field Model) for contextual grounding, but it does not rely on them for authority or legitimacy.

No external system is required to “complete” MMM.

---

## Final Boundary Statement

MMM does not seek to deepen mystery.

It seeks to **make mystery legible without enlarging it**.

If this material reduces confusion, restores discernment, or helps a reader step back rather than lean in, it is functioning as intended.
