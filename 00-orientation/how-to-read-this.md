# How to Read This

## There Is No Correct Way to Read This Repository

This repository is not a course, a path, or a progression.

You are not expected to:
- read everything,
- read in order,
- or finish the material.

Nothing here builds toward a conclusion.

Stopping early is a valid and often appropriate outcome.

---

## Read for Orientation, Not Immersion

MMM is designed to provide **orientation**, not experience.

If you notice yourself:
- wanting to “go deeper,”
- feeling drawn toward symbolic interpretation,
- or treating the material as revelatory,

that is a signal to slow down or pause.

The goal is clarity, not absorption.

---

## Skipping Is Encouraged

Some sections may be useful.
Others may not apply.

You are encouraged to:
- skim,
- skip entire directories,
- or read only a single file.

This is not a loss of value.
It is correct usage.

---

## This Is Not a Test of Understanding

You do not need to:
- agree with the framework,
- adopt its language,
- or retain its concepts.

If a distinction is helpful, use it.
If it is not, leave it behind.

MMM does not require belief or commitment.

---

## If the Material Feels Destabilising

If reading produces:
- confusion,
- derealisation,
- pressure to reinterpret experience,
- or a desire to dissolve identity or responsibility,

pause and disengage.

The material will still be here later.
Your stability matters more than completion.

---

## Reading Pace

Slow reading is preferable to deep reading.

Spacing sessions out, rereading selectively, or returning later
often produces better understanding than sustained engagement.

There is no benefit to intensity.

---

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

MMM may reference other models (such as the Dynamic Field Model / Signal OS) for context.

These references are optional.
They are not prerequisites.

If unfamiliar terms appear, it is acceptable to ignore them.

---

## Final Note

MMM is successful if it:
- reduces confusion,
- restores discernment,
- or makes it easier to step back from meaning pressure.

If you find yourself needing the framework less over time,
it has done its job.

You are not meant to stay here.
