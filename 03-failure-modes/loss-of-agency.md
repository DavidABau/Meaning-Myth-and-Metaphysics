# Loss of Agency

## What Loss of Agency Means

In MMM, **loss of agency** refers to a reduced sense of capacity to choose, act, or influence outcomes in concrete ways.

This loss is often subtle.
It does not always appear as helplessness or passivity.

It may instead feel like:
- acceptance,
- surrender,
- or deep trust in “how things unfold.”

MMM treats loss of agency as a **functional consequence**, not a moral failure.

## How Agency Erodes

Agency erodes when:
- boundaries soften without re-differentiation,
- responsibility is reframed as illusory or unnecessary,
- or action is consistently deferred to interpretation.

When dissolution becomes a resting place rather than a phase,
decision-making gradually weakens.

The system remains coherent,
but less capable of directed change.

## Agency vs Control

Loss of agency is often confused with release of control.

Releasing control can be healthy.
Losing agency is not.

- Control refers to forcing outcomes.
- Agency refers to the ability to respond, choose, and participate.

Meaning systems that conflate the two
can quietly undermine agency while appearing wise.

## Passive Coherence

A common pattern is **passive coherence**.

The system feels internally aligned,
yet external conditions remain unchanged or deteriorate.

This occurs when:
- insight substitutes for action,
- interpretation replaces engagement,
- and meaning absorbs tension without resolving it.

Passive coherence is stable but non-adaptive.

---

## Responsibility Diffusion

Loss of agency often involves diffusion of responsibility.

Responsibility may be:
- attributed to the universe,
- dissolved into unity,
- or deferred to unfolding processes.

While this can reduce guilt or pressure,
it also reduces capacity to intervene when intervention is needed.

MMM does not argue for constant action.
It argues for **available action**.

## Relation to the Core Axis

Loss of agency reflects prolonged residence on the **dissolution** side of the axis.

Without return to differentiation:
- choice weakens,
- consequence becomes abstract,
- and participation diminishes.

Differentiation restores agency
by reintroducing boundary, role, and responsibility.

---

## Signs of Loss of Agency

Possible indicators include:
- difficulty making practical decisions,
- reluctance to set boundaries,
- chronic deferral to interpretation,
- or framing action as unnecessary or misguided.

These signs often appear reasonable from within the system.

---

## Restoration of Agency

Agency is restored through:
- re-engagement with concrete tasks,
- acceptance of limitation,
- and tolerance for imperfection.

Action does not need to be forceful.
It needs to be **real**.

---

## Orientation

Loss of agency is not failure.
It is a predictable outcome of certain meaning dynamics.

Recognising it early allows rebalancing
before stagnation or dependency sets in.

MMM prioritises agency
because without it,
meaning ceases to serve life.
