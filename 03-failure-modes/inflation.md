# Inflation

## What Inflation Is

In MMM, **inflation** refers to a condition where meaning, identity, or interpretation expands beyond its actual scope.

Inflation is not arrogance.
It is a **structural side effect** of high coherence combined with softened boundaries.

When interpretation feels total and unquestionable, the system begins to overestimate its reach.

## How Inflation Arises

Inflation commonly arises when:
- dissolution reduces internal conflict,
- emotional relief increases certainty,
- and symbolic meaning feels directly real.

As differentiation decreases:
- distinctions blur,
- feedback weakens,
- and internal experience gains disproportionate authority.

The result is an expanded sense of insight, importance, or access.

## Inflation Without Ego

Inflation does not require ego or self-aggrandisement.

It can appear as:
- certainty without superiority,
- insight without boastfulness,
- or humility paired with unexamined authority.

A person may feel they have “disappeared,”
while the interpretation itself quietly becomes absolute.

---

## Signs of Inflation

Common indicators include:
- difficulty tolerating alternative interpretations,
- interpreting disagreement as misunderstanding or fear,
- assuming personal insight applies universally,
- or feeling that ordinary concerns are somehow beneath relevance.

These signs are often subtle and internally justified.

## Why Inflation Feels Stable

Inflation feels stable because:
- internal coherence is high,
- doubt has been resolved,
- and meaning is unified.

The system no longer needs to negotiate ambiguity.

This stability is real — but brittle.
It depends on maintaining the interpretive frame.

## Inflation vs Integration

Integration increases:
- flexibility,
- responsiveness,
- and tolerance for difference.

Inflation increases:
- certainty,
- explanatory reach,
- and interpretive closure.

They can feel similar initially.
They diverge under challenge.

When pressure increases:
- integration adapts,
- inflation defends.

## Relationship to the Core Axis

Inflation occurs when dissolution is:
- treated as arrival rather than phase,
- decoupled from re-differentiation,
- or insulated from consequence.

It represents **residence at one pole** of the axis.

---

## Protective Factors

Inflation is mitigated by:
- maintaining ordinary responsibility,
- re-engaging with concrete constraints,
- tolerating not-knowing,
- and allowing interpretations to remain provisional.

Differentiation restores proportion.

## Orientation

Inflation is not a personal flaw.
It is a predictable outcome of certain meaning dynamics.

Naming it reduces harm.
Recognising it early preserves agency.

MMM treats inflation as a **mechanical risk**, not a moral failure.
