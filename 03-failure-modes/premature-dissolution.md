# Premature Dissolution

## What Premature Dissolution Is

**Premature dissolution** occurs when boundary-softening and unity-oriented interpretations are introduced **before sufficient differentiation is established**.

This is not about the content of a meaning system.
It is about **timing**.

Dissolution applied too early does not liberate.
It destabilises.

---

## Differentiation as Prerequisite

Differentiation provides:
- stable identity,
- clear responsibility,
- tolerance for ambiguity,
- and capacity for action.

Without these, dissolution removes the very structures
that allow a system to remain coherent.

MMM treats differentiation not as a limitation,
but as a **necessary foundation**.

---

## Why Premature Dissolution Is Attractive

Premature dissolution often appeals because it:
- offers immediate relief,
- reduces conflict,
- and promises resolution without effort.

For individuals under stress, trauma, or uncertainty,
this can feel like rescue.

The problem is not the relief.
It is the **cost paid later**.

---

## Common Contexts for Premature Dissolution

Premature dissolution frequently appears when:
- identity is fragile or under strain,
- responsibility feels overwhelming,
- suffering seeks rapid explanation,
- or authority is deferred to symbolic systems.

In these contexts, dissolution replaces development
rather than complementing it.

---

## How It Manifests

Signs of premature dissolution include:
- dismissal of ordinary concerns as illusory,
- bypassing developmental or relational work,
- adopting universal explanations too quickly,
- or treating ambiguity as something to dissolve rather than tolerate.

These moves feel sophisticated.
They often reduce resilience.

## Why the Damage Is Subtle

Premature dissolution rarely looks like collapse.

Instead, it produces:
- surface coherence,
- reduced emotional friction,
- and convincing narratives of completion.

Because distress decreases initially,
the long-term loss of capacity can go unnoticed.

MMM names this pattern so it can be recognised early.

---

## Relation to Other Failure Modes

Premature dissolution underlies:
- inflation (certainty without proportion),
- bypass (relief without resolution),
- and loss of agency (coherence without action).

Addressing sequencing resolves many secondary issues
without targeting them directly.

---

## Restoration Through Re-Differentiation

Restoration does not require rejecting dissolution.

It requires **return**.

Re-differentiation involves:
- re-engaging responsibility,
- restoring boundary where needed,
- and accepting limitation as stabilising.

This return is not regression.
It is completion of the cycle.

---

## Orientation

Dissolution is powerful.
That is why timing matters.

MMM does not argue against dissolution.
It argues against using it **before the system can sustain it**.

Differentiation first.
Dissolution second.
Return required.
