# Meaning as Interface

## Meaning Is an Interface, Not a Substance

In MMM, meaning is treated as an **interface**.

It is not a property of the universe, nor a hidden layer of reality.
It is a human-constructed mediation layer that helps organisms:
- orient attention,
- prioritise action,
- coordinate socially,
- and regulate emotional load.

Meaning does not reveal reality.
It **shapes how reality is encountered**.

## Why Humans Generate Meaning Systems

Humans operate in environments that are:
- complex,
- uncertain,
- and often overwhelming.

Meaning systems arise to:
- compress complexity,
- reduce ambiguity,
- and provide orientation when direct perception is insufficient.

They function as **cognitive compression tools**:
turning vast, ambiguous input into actionable narratives or symbols.

This is adaptive.
It is also risky when mistaken for literal truth.

## Interface Layers and Transparency

An interface works best when its limits are visible.

When meaning systems are recognised as interfaces:
- symbols remain symbolic,
- metaphors remain metaphors,
- and interpretation stays flexible.

Problems arise when the interface becomes opaque —
when users forget they are interacting with a mediation layer
and begin treating it as reality itself.

MMM exists to restore interface transparency.

## How Interfaces Feel Convincing

Meaning systems feel compelling because they:
- reduce cognitive load,
- increase coherence,
- and provide explanatory closure.

This often produces:
- relief,
- emotional resonance,
- and a sense of “this makes sense now.”

These effects are **functional**, not evidentiary.

Feeling convinced is a feature of compression,
not proof of correspondence with reality.

---

## Identity Binding

Interfaces often bind to identity.

When a meaning system becomes part of who someone *is*:
- disagreement feels like threat,
- ambiguity feels intolerable,
- and revision feels like loss.

Identity binding increases stability in the short term,
but reduces adaptability over time.

MMM treats identity binding as a **mechanical outcome**, not a moral flaw.

## Differentiation and Dissolution at the Interface Level

The Differentiation ↔ Dissolution axis expresses itself through interfaces:

- Differentiation-oriented interfaces emphasise:
  - clear roles,
  - explicit rules,
  - and actionable meaning.

- Dissolution-oriented interfaces emphasise:
  - symbolic unity,
  - experiential coherence,
  - and reduction of distinction.

Neither is inherently superior.
Each shapes attention and behaviour differently.

## When Interfaces Become Hazardous

Meaning interfaces become hazardous when:
- they discourage revision,
- they suppress external feedback,
- or they override lived consequence.

At this point, meaning stops serving navigation
and begins serving self-protection or authority.

Recognising this transition early is a core goal of MMM.

---

## Orientation

Meaning is useful precisely because it is **not reality**.

Treating it as an interface allows:
- appreciation without submission,
- insight without surrender,
- and coherence without loss of agency.

MMM does not remove meaning.
It puts it back in its proper place.
